# Mobility as a Service (MaaS)

A mobility as a service application aims to solve the ever increasing mobility challanges in urban environments, with an intermodal route planning solution based on public transport and every king of shared mobility services. A well developed MaaS application attempts to compete with the individual car ownership, by offering the same freedom and versatility as a car at a lower price, and without the inconviniences of car ownership.

## Intermodal route planning experiments

1.  At first the UrbanAccess Python library was tested to create a transport network graph by integrating OSM data with GTFS dataset on the example of Budapest and its agglomeration. The connection of the map graph and the public transport graph is not clear so this course was abandoned.

2.  A graph representation of an intermodal route planning application was implemented based on this [PhD thesis](http://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/teaching/radaUIB/disertace_Hrncir.pdf)
